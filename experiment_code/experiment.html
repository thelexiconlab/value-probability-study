In addition to the board, you will see a clue. You should think of this clue as coming from a friend or teammate, who is trying to indicate two of the words on the board without directly saying either of them. So, your goal is to interpret the clue and select the two words that you think are the most likely targets for that clue. <br> <br> You will see a wide variety of clues. Keep in mind that some clues are better than others, but all clues are intended to point you toward two of the words on the board. If you are ever unfamiliar with a word, please do not pause to look it up, as this will interfere with the data. Instead, please use the knowledge you already have and make selections to the best of your ability, as this will give the most authentic response. </p>",
