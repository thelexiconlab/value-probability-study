You should think of this clue as coming from a friend or teammate, who is trying to indicate two of the words on the board without directly saying either of them.

The words you click will turn green as a confirmation that they have been selected. If you accidentally click a word, or if you wish to change your choice, simply click a selected word to unselect it, and it will go back to gray. When exactly two words are selected, the Enter Responses button will illuminate. Once you are satisfied with your choices, click the Enter Responses button, and the experiment will automatically move to the next trial. <br> <br> To familiarize you with the game, there are four practice trials. As you play the game, be sure to attend to both speed and accuracy. In other words, make guesses that you think are likely to be correct, but don't linger too long on any one board.
